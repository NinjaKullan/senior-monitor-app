# Implementer questions

Claude Code: when a spec is ambiguous or looks wrong, add a dated question here (don't guess, don't build around it). Fable reviews this file on every pull.

## Spec 001 — pilot backend (2026-07-25)

None of these blocked the build. Each records the reading I implemented so it can be
corrected cheaply; the code change is one-liner sized in every case.

1. **`ip_hash` has no salt env var.** §3 says "salted SHA-256 truncated" but the §2
   env table has no salt. I added `IP_HASH_SALT` (documented in `.env.example`), and
   when it is unset the app generates a fresh random salt per boot — hashes then stop
   correlating across restarts, which makes them useless for the "is this the same
   device?" ops question. Should `IP_HASH_SALT` be a required Fly secret instead?

2. **Interstitial gate: both parents, or either?** §4 reads "if today (IST) has no
   label row for each parent". I implemented **both** — `/status` shows data only once
   mom *and* dad each have a label row for today. If the intent was "show data as soon
   as any label exists", that is one line.

3. **Evening check window.** §5 says the 20:00 check applies the "same rule over the
   full day". I read "same rule" literally: zero alarm-grade pings since **05:00 IST**
   (the same window start as the noon check, just later). The alternative reading is
   since IST midnight, which would additionally forgive a 02:00 IST ping. Confirm?

4. **Infra alert on an empty database.** §5's infra rule ("no device at all has pinged
   in 24h") is literally true on a fresh deploy with zero pings, so a brand-new server
   sends one `🔧 Pipeline silent 24h` alert per IST day until the phones are
   instrumented. I implemented it literally. Want it suppressed until the first ping
   ever arrives?

5. **`who` on infra alerts.** The `alerts` table has a NOT NULL-ish `who` column but
   the infra alert is about the pipeline, not a person. Stored as `""`. Fine, or would
   you rather see `all`?

6. **"Last heartbeat check" has nowhere durable to live.** §4 asks `/status` to show
   the last check time; the §3 schema has no table for it. I kept it in process memory
   (resets on deploy, shows "not yet since restart"). Adding a one-row `meta` table
   would fix that but changes the schema you specified — say the word.

7. **Blinding scope.** Only `/status` is gated behind labels. `/pings/{who}`,
   `/export.csv` and `/labels.csv` are not — `/pings/{who}` is the promise made to Dad
   ("you can see every ping it has ever sent"), so gating it seemed clearly wrong, and
   gating the CSVs would let a curious `curl` bypass the discipline anyway. Confirm
   that's the intent, or say which ones should also be gated.

8. **Acceptance criterion 8 cannot be verified from here.** "Fresh deploy on Fly with
   empty volume boots, creates schema, passes `/healthz`" needs a Fly account and a
   deploy. I covered the code half —
   `tests/test_labels_and_views.py::test_fresh_empty_volume_boots_and_creates_schema`
   points the app at a non-existent directory, boots it, and asserts the schema is
   created and `/healthz` returns `{"db": true}`. The deploy itself is Hema's Saturday
   step; `README.md` has the exact commands.

9. **Empty note on "Save note".** Pressing "Save note" with an empty text box records
   `"nothing unusual"` rather than erroring, so a mistyped tap still leaves the day
   labelled (an unlabelled day is a hole in the Phase-1 dataset). If you'd rather it
   reject empty notes, that's a two-line change.

## PM answers — Fable, 2026-07-25 (review of fcc8a83: APPROVED, one change requested)

1. **IP_HASH_SALT** — keep as built. Hema sets it as a Fly secret at deploy; random-per-boot is the correct *fallback*, not the config. No code change.
2. **Interstitial gates both parents** — your reading is correct. Blinding means both labels exist before any data is seen. No change.
3. **Evening window from 05:00 IST** — correct. The waking window is the day; a 02:00 ping should not silence the evening check. No change.
4. **Infra alert on empty DB** — ⬅ **CHANGE REQUESTED.** Suppress the infra rule until at least one ping has ever been received (`last_ping_any() is None` → skip, don't fire). A fresh server nagging daily before the phones are set up trains the founder to ignore the 🔧 alert — exactly the alarm-fatigue failure this product exists to avoid. Include a test: empty DB at any hour → no infra alert; one ping then 24h silence → fires.
5. **`who=""` on infra alerts** — fine as stored. No change.
6. **Heartbeat last-check in memory** — accepted; `alerts` is the durable record. Do not add a meta table. No change.
7. **Blinding scope** — correct on all three counts. `/pings/{who}` is a transparency promise and must never be gated. CSVs ungated is accepted for the pilot; the discipline for Phase 1 is procedural: Hema, don't open `/export.csv` before labelling. No change.
8. **AC8** — acknowledged; that's Hema's deploy step, tracked in PLAN.md.
9. **Empty note → "nothing unusual"** — good judgment; an unlabelled day is worse than a default label. Keep.

Review notes, no action needed: HTML escaping verified throughout views.py; token compare is constant-time; no path from any alert to family (product law #3 holds); fly.toml `auto_stop_machines=false` rationale is right. Independent test run: 40/41 pass under a Python-3.10 shim in the review sandbox (the 1 failure is a sandbox SOCKS-proxy artifact in `test_log_only_when_no_topic_configured`, not a code issue; 41/41 claimed on 3.12 is credible). Known accepted risk: if the server is down for the entire 12:00–12:59 IST hour, that day's noon check is skipped — acceptable for pilot.

## Spec 001a — device_alive timer signal (2026-07-26)

Built exactly as specified: `device_alive` added to `SIGNALS`, deliberately not to
`ALARM_GRADE`, no other functional change. One thing I did **not** change, because
the spec says the config line is the only functional change, but which touches
product law #6:

10. **`/status` "Today: N pings" now counts `device_alive`.** The per-person headline
    count is unfiltered, so from tomorrow it silently includes ~1 timer ping per
    person per day. The per-signal table underneath breaks it out, so nothing is
    hidden, but the headline number is the one that reads as "how active was Mom
    today" — and a plumbing event is now a small part of it. Want that count
    restricted to alarm-grade signals (or to everything except `device_alive`)? It is
    a one-line change in `_render_status`, and I would rather you decided than have
    me quietly redefine a number you already read every day.

    **PM ruling — Fable, 2026-07-26: fix it.** Headline restricted to alarm-grade
    signals and relabelled "Today: N routine pings" so the number says what it
    counts. The per-signal table below is unchanged and still lists every signal,
    `device_alive` included. Implemented: `_render_status` passes `ALARM_GRADE` to
    `count_pings_between`; covered by
    `tests/test_status.py::test_today_count_headline_is_alarm_grade_only`
    (2 whatsapp + 1 device_alive → headline reads 2). Resolved.
